	<p>My name is Jason Howie. I am an aspiring Web developer looking to further my education in programming and
	potentially find full-time work doing it. Currently I have spent about six months learning programming and I recently
	finished the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree with Udacity, and I plan on going into a second Nanodegree to 
	further my education. I am always pursuing to learn more, create and experience new technology.</p>
	<p><strong>I am versed in:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>JavaScript (+ JQuery)</li>
		<li>Development Tools (Command Line, Git & Github)</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Bootstrap</li>
		<li>Jekyll</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Before I took the journey on the life of a programming, I was pursuing a degree in Music. Vocal Performance to be
	exact. I have a passion in performing and have performed in everything from Operas to contemporary acapella-pop groups
	and everything in between. I went to Kent State Universty and graduated with a degree in Music with a concentration in
	Vocal Performance. Although I loved performance I felt I needed to make myself more marketable, and found programming 
	which I am starting to enjoy just as much.</p>
