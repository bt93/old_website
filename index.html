	<p>Before I took the journey on the life of a programming, I was pursuing a degree in Music. Vocal Performance to be
	exact. I have a passion in performing and have performed in everything from Operas to contemporary pop-accapella groups
	and everything in between. I went to Kent State Universty and graduated with a degree in Music with a concentration in
	Vocal Performance. Although I loved performance I felt I needed to make myself more marketable, and found programming 
	which I am starting to enjoy just as much.</p>
