Game Two was closer than Game One, but Boston won it again to take a commanding 2-0 lead on the series.

The Dodgers could only muster 2 runs on 3 hits off of lefty David Price, who had probably one of his best post-season performances of his career. LA's Hyun-Jin Ryu pitched well too, but didn't get a lot of help from his bullpen, who gave up 3 inherited runs on a big hit by JD Martinzez in the 5th. Bostons bullpen really held it down well late in the game, refusing to give up any baserunners. This game felt like a quick one, because of the great pitching.

LA will try to get their first win at home on Friday. They'll be sending in rookie [Walker Buehler](https://www.mlb.com/player/walker-buehler-621111). Boston will bring in former Cy Young award winner [Rick Porcello](https://www.mlb.com/player/rick-porcello-519144).
