It wasn't much of a match. The Sox pounced early, with a two run homer by Steve Pearce. The Dodgers could only muster one run off a lead off home run by David Freese in the first. David Price was on it only giving up a run in seven innings.

This was probably the least exciting game to watch this series. Which is sad because it's also the last baseball game of the season. I like watching the season go out with a bang.

Well, till next year, I suppose.
