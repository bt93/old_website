I am an avid fan of baseball, I enjoy it's history and it's ability to stay relevent in modern times. Although I live in the Cleveland area and am a big fan of the Cleveland Indians, I still enjoy the game even when my team isn't playing. I also like to keep score as a hobby. It really is a great way to get into the game. So I decided to show my score books through-out this years World Series, between the Boston Red Sox and The Los Angeles Dodgers.

So Here is Game One:

Game One began with a bang, on a cold evening in Boston, with both offenses scoring early. Boston started with Mookie Betts singling in the first and stealing second. Andrew Benintendi drove him in and JD Martinez drove in Benintendi. The Dodgers bounced back the next inning with a solo homer by Matt Kemp. In the third LA tied up the game with an RBI single by Manny Machado, the mid-season pickup by the Dodgers. But the Sox came back to get the lead on an RBI double by JD Martinez. It was a constant back and forth with a tied score in to the bottom of the fifth. Boson Third-Baseman Rafael Devers drove in a run to give Boston the lead, but the real dagger was a pinch hit 3-run homer by Eduardo Nunez to help Boston take a 1-0 lead in the series.

Because of the starters it was thought this would be a low-scoring game. But that was not the case. LA lefty Clayton Kershaw gave up five runs in four innings. On the other side Boston lefty Chris Sale surrendered three runs on four innings.

This series should be a fun one to watch. For game two, Boston will be putting out left-hander [David Price](https://www.mlb.com/player/david-price-456034?stats=career-p-pitching-mlb), while LA will send out another lefty, [Hyun-Jun Ryu](https://www.mlb.com/player/hyun-jin-ryu-547943?stats=career-p-pitching-mlb).
