Wow. Game Three turned out to be the longest game in World Series history. It ended up being SEVEN hours long spanning eighteen innings! It was about three in the morning on the east coast by the time this thing was over. 

Quite honestly I so much happened I can't even remember it all so I'll just leave you with the score book.
