Game four was... less long. But it certainly was a nail-bitter.

Not much scoring happened untill the sixth. Yasiel Puig hit a 3 run bomb to put the Dondgers on top, looking like they could tie up the series. But Bostons offence came swinging the next few innings, tieing up the game and getting a late lead in the ninth. LA just could'nt come back from it and the Red Sox lead the series with a commanding 3-1 lead. They'll look to win the series tonight.
