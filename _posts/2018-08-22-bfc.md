Many of those who know me know that I am a member of the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus. I’m a second-year member of their full chorus and I’ve sung with their Blossom Festival Chorus over the last few summers too. The Blossom Festival Chorus (BFC) is the Orchestra’s “summer” chorus. Generally, the BFC will be in concerts at the Blossom Music Center, which is the Orchestra’s “summer home”. Blossom Music Center is in its 50th anniversary of opening.

For those not familiar, Blossom is one of those hidden gems in Northeast Ohio. It’s a gorgeous outdoor amphitheatre in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, about 30 miles south of Cleveland. It can house about 20,000 people and has enormous lawn spanning through the house of the pavilion. It’s quite possibly my favorite places to be during the Summer months. It holds concerts by The Cleveland Orchestra as well as the bigger popular rock, pop and country acts. Just this summer there have been concerts by Foo Fighters, Jimmy Buffett, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Rascal Flatts. There have even been some fairly big names from the Classical and Broadway world, like Audra McDonald and Yo-Yo Ma.

The Blossom Festival Chorus will be performing Carl Orff’s *Carmina Burana* on August 25th, which is most famous for its opening movement [O Fortuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIcgUSJiEQQ). The reason this performance is so important is that it marks exactly 50 years to the **day** that this Chorus along with the Cleveland Orchestra performed this exact piece of music. Whoever did the scheduling for this concert should get a promotion because that apparently was not the intention, and no one knew about this until earlier this week. It’ll be a very exciting experience, knowing the significance of this performance.
