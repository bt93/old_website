Click on the cards and try to match with the coresponding card. Every two cards clicked a move counter is incremented. On the first move a timer starts. If you reach 20 moves the first star is removed. If you reach 40 moves the second is removed. Once you match every card correctly A modal will apear that will give you your final score and prompt you to try again. If you click restart the game will restart and re-shuffle the cards.
