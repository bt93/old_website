	    <p class="card-text">A recreation of the video game "Frogger" for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.
	    Try to reach the water using the arrow keys on your keyboard without colliding with the enemy bugs. If you reach the end, you get a point. If you collide with a bug, you lose a life. If you get to zero lives, you go back to zero points.
		This game was used to demonstrate knowledge in object-oriented JavaScript.</p>

	    I was given a website design in <a href="https://github.com/bt93/Build-a-Portfolio-Site/blob/master/images/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> form and recreated it with HTML and CSS. Though it is not my actual
		profile website, I used it to demenstrate my abilities in responsive design. I used a mobile first aproach when
		putting this page together.</p>
