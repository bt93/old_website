	<h5>My First Blog</h5>
	<h6>Thursday - 08/16/18</h6>
	<p>The story of a kid with a dream, a kid who, wanted to be a professional singer. Going through college with nothing but that in my mind. At 25 years old, I’m not necessarily abandoning that, but simply changing my course a bit I graduated from Kent State with a degree in Music wanting to become the greatest operatic baritone you ever had seen. Since then I’ve changed my sights into Programming.</p>

<p>I can’t really say what caused this changed. Well actually I can. It’s hard to make a living as an opera singer alone. I was very passionate about it during my undergrad. It’s all I ever thought about, except for what I was going to do <code class="highlighter-rouge">AFTER</code> graduation. Fairly soon my Dad told me to look into Coding. I knew it was all the phase these days, and rightfully so. But I had no clue if I had any future in it. Would I be smart enough? Would I like it?</p>

<p>So, I started looking up some of the info in order to do it. I found a bunch of different ways to learn it. From Code Academy, Treehouse, FreeCodeCamp and finally Udacity. I just started learning, and when I realized that I had an interest in it, I wanted to learn more. I kept going and going. Eventually I fount that I really enjoyed Web Development the most. There is something really rewarding to know that I can contribute to one of the greatest human achievements, the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>I’m still learning even some of the basics, but I’m finding myself more and more invested in this path. I’m currently working on a second Nanodegree from Udacity, and my hope is to find work doing this. Eventually I want to take it further and learn the Back-End of Web Development. But I figure one step at a time.</p>

<p>So, this blog will serve as more or less a look into my journey through all of this, as well as other things I find interesting or amusing. Welcome into my life!</p>
